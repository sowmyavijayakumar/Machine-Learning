# Machine-Learning
Course Work

The goal of this assignment is to design, implement and evaluate your own implementation of a machine learning algorithm. You may choose any classification algorithm, whether we have covered it in lectures or not, except for k-Nearest Neighbours, Naïve Bayes, or rather trivial ones such as ZeroR or 1R.
Implementation details:
You may use any programming/scripting language you wish, but it must be entirely your own work, NOT based in any part on an implementation found elsewhere.
You may make any reasonable design decisions, and should document them (e.g. distance metric if kNN were allowed).
It must be possible to input training data and testing data to your program, for example from a file or files, in a reasonable format of your choosing. Your program must be able to handle different numbers of attributes and training cases. For testing data, it must be able to output predicted and actual values to a file.
To test your program:
You will be provided with a file called “owls.csv”.
Each line describes one type of Owl found in Ireland: body-length, wing-length, body-width, wing-width, type.
There are three types: Barn Owl, Snowy Owl & Long-Eared Owl. Your classifier is to distinguish between them.
You (or your program) should randomly divide the file into 2/3 for training, 1/3 for testing. The training data are the cases your machine learning algorithm will use. It will attempt to classify the testing cases, and should compute the accuracy of classifications.
This procedure should be repeated with different random divisions 10 times, and the individual results and average accuracy reported.
Please submit a short report (approximately 2-3 pages + code) with:
Your name and class (4BCT, 4BP, …)
A description of your algorithm and design decisions.
Your tests and results.
Conclusions and observations.
Your code, attached as an appendix.
You must submit a printed report on the day it is due, or before. You must also upload two items separately:
Your report (including code in the appendix) as a single PDF file
A zip file with all of your code.
This is an individual assignment. As you are all final year or postgraduate students, I will treat any plagiarism (from another student or other sources) very seriously. If any aspect of your work is plagiarised or is otherwise dishonest, you will receive 0 for the full assignment..
This assignment will carry a higher weight than the previous ones. Marking scheme (out of 15):
Any aspect plagiarised or otherwise dishonest: 0 for full assignment
Implementation: 2 for code with significant flaws; 7 for fully correct code; or in between.
Testing: 0 for no testing or couldn’t get it to work; 3 for high quality and comprehensive tests
Detailed report documenting all aspects as specified above: 3
Particularly high quality implementation and report: 2
